# Hello Second Post!

## TIME TO FERMENT

Once the mixture has cooled down, it is moved to the fermentation tanks. Our top fermentation beers, like Charles Quint and Tongerlo, ferment for a period of 5 to 6 days at a temperature between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius. The bottom fermentation beers, including our Primus, ferment for a period of 8 to 10 days at 10 to 12 degrees Celsius.

## What’s the difference?

The description top and bottom fermentation doesn’t just have to do with the difference in temperatures, but mostly with the yeast. In the case of top fermentation beers, the yeast floats up at the end of the process. In the case of bottom fermentation beers, the yeast sinks to the bottom of the tank.
