      <p>
        Because Haacht Brewery is 100% Belgian and authentic, we understand the
        Belgians like no other. We know they love their beer well-drawn and that
        theyâ€™re very fond of good food and drinks. They enjoy things quietly.
        Not just at home, but also at the bar, in a restaurant and during events
        like festivals and races.
