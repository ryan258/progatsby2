      <h2>DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE BELGIAN BEER LANDSCAPE</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a true Belgian family-run brewery, now led by the fourth
        generation and we specifically choose to stay independent. 11 100%

      <h2>BELGIAN AND AUTHENTIC </h2>
      <p>
        Because Haacht Brewery is 100% Belgian and authentic, we understand the
        Belgians like no other. We know they love their beer well-drawn and that
        they’re very fond of good food and drinks. They enjoy things quietly.
        Not just at home, but also at the bar, in a restaurant and during events
        like festivals and races.
